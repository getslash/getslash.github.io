We're pleased to announce the official 1.0.0 release of the Slash testing framework!

This release marks over 3 years of hard work we've put into Slash and its surrounding ecosystem, continuously improving and adding more features and squashing more bugs.

We've learned a lot from our experience building our testing solutions around Slash; We fine tuned the delicate balance between power and maintainability, learned how to make the infrastructure easier for newcomers (both developers and test authors) and we've also learned a lot from other testing tools out there.

Release 1.0.0 is just the beginning for us. We'll be spending the near future improving on the ecosystem around Slash (with Backslash in the lead), and we have many more cool features planned in store.

We'd like to also thank the contributors who helped with pull requests and reporting bugs. Building a complex project such as Slash requires patience and we appreciate you bearing with us!

As usual, feel free to report any issues and suggest ideas through GitHub -- we're always listening.


Happy testing!

The Slash Team
