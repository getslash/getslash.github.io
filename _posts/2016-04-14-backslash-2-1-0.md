We're proud to announce the release of version 2.1.0 of the Backslash test reporting service. 

This release represents a major overhaul in both UI and functionality. Below are some highlights of the new release:

## Major UI Overhaul

The Backslash UI has undergone a major facelift. The interface is clearer and cleaner, and it is easier to get around

## Keyboard Shortcuts

We added keyboard shortcuts to ease your workflow:

- `.` opens quick-jump, allowing you to quickly jump to a specific user or subject under test
- `F` and `A`, when in sessions or tests view, show only failed items or all items respectively
- `Esc` takes you to the home screen
- `?` shows all available shortcuts

We've also introduced many many more subtle features and improvements to Backslash's inner workings. We're sure you'll find them useful for your everyday workflow!

We hope you enjoy this release as much as we enjoyed making it happen. Now we're off to start working on v3.0.0, which has sooooo much more going for it!
