    <h1>Log Lifetime Management Made Simple</h1>
    <p>
      Scotty allows you to upload logs and various other artifacts from various locations into a single, centralized place. This allows developers to inspect them at their leisure, allowing the original location to be freed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most prominent use case for Scotty is running many different machines where an incident requiring log inspection might happen occasionally, and where debug logs can be very large. In such cases it is wasteful to have a lot of storage space available on all machines just to keep the logs for long periods.
    </p>

    <p>
      Log uploads can be done through the web UI, or through a dedicated programmatic API
    </p>

    <p>
      Scotty tracks the lifetime of the uploaded logs, deleting them after a specified period automatically if no longer needed. This gives you peace of mind, freeing you from worrying about your overall used storage space.
