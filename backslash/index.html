  <h1>What is Backslash?</h1>
  <p>
    Backslash is a centralized test reporting and tracking service. It allows you to keep track of ongoing automated test execution, follow ongoing issues, and get a better estimate of your project's code quality.

      <h3>Track Session Execution -- in one Place</h3>
      <p>Backslash stores automation session information efficiently. It allows you to backtrack execution status - including successful runs, skips, errors and more.

      <h3>Investigate Errors Efficiently</h3>
      <p>Backslash allows you to take a quick glance at errors, spot non-issues with ease, and drill deep into the root cause of failed tests and sessions.</p>
      <p>Backslash captures failure and exception tracebacks from code and displays them, allowing you to investigate without leaving your chair.</p>

      <h3>Moderate Results</h3>
      <p>Stay on top of your regression tests -- sort real issues from false positives. You can archive sessions you decide are not relevant for your testing effort, and you can quickly mark failures as investigated, avoiding unnecessary churn</p>
      <p>Backslash also allows you to comment on tests and sessions, giving you a place to preserve the information you extract</p>
